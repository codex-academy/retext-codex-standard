This is all about OSM, which we use at codex
quite a bit. Sometimes we export it to geoJSON.

But this time when we mention `json` it should not
produce an error.

```json
{
  "token": "<token>"
}
```

{% highlight json %}
{
  "token": "<token>"
}
{% endhighlight %}

It's also wrong to use insensitive language like crazy.
